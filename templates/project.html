                <h2>Need: Why is GuideRadPROS project needed?</h2>
                <p>Photon dosimeters are almost universally used in all radiation practices, covering personal and
                    environmental monitoring, and emergency response, to assess the protection of people from harmful
                    effects of ionising radiation. In the EU, the requirements for dose assessment and monitoring are
                    set in Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom, which is implemented in national legislations. Comparable
                    world-wide requirements are given in IAEA Safety Standard Series No. GSR Part 3: General Safety
                    Requirements. </p>

                        <p>Radiation protection dosimeters measure ambient dose equivalent, directional dose equivalent,
                            or personal dose equivalent. These dosimeters are tested and calibrated in photon reference
                            fields according to the ISO 4037:2019 standard series. In the 2019 update, many changes were
                            introduced in the ISO 4037 standard. The new requirements result in high costs and manpower
                            to establish such reference fields and therefore, small laboratories and emerging metrology
                            institutes have not been able to fully implement the standard.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, there is a need to provide guidance to implement ISO 4037 series and to provide
                            missing data regarding 241Am reference fields, high voltage measurements of x-ray units and
                            the associated uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, harmonized procedures for traceable X-ray
                            spectrometry are needed.</p>

                            as use of spectrodosimetry, new technologies related, e.g., to the use of machine learning,
                            artificial intelligence, and other methods based on computation. Therefore, the standards
                            must be harmonized, and future standardisation needs must be analysed. </p>

<!--                <p>Outcomes for industrial and other user communities </p>-->
<!--                <p>The revision of the ISO 4037 standards and the adoption of the ICRU Report 95 operational quantities have an impact on realization of radiation beam qualities and the value of the conversion coefficients from air kerma to dose equivalents, respectively. The new operational quantities introduced in ICRU Report 95, the ambient dose and personal dose, have a different energy and angle dependence with respect to the incident radiation field compared to the current quantities. Thus, these new quantities require changes in the characteristics of the measuring equipment. These changes will have consequences for all industrial stakeholders, including calibration laboratories, dosimeter manufacturers, dosimetry services and users of ionizing radiation in industry, research and medical applications where radiation protection measurements are needed. The change affects the legal dose limits given in Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom, thus requiring careful consideration of how the dose limits should be set in future update of the directive. </p>-->
<!--                <p>The changes made to ISO standards and especially the adoption of the spectrometric characterization of radiation beams will improve the harmonization of calibration beams and their traceability to national references and the accuracy of the calibrations. The latter can be drastically improved allowing a more precise and comparable characterization of the measuring devices. Together with harmonized IEC standards this leads to the revision of the type tests carried out before the devices are put on the market. </p>-->
<!--                <p>This project will assess the consequences on radiation protection measurements and dosimeters caused by the adoption of new operational quantities proposed in the ICRU Report 95 and inform the manufacturers who will then be able to anticipate the prospected changes, by planning the recalibration, replacement, or adaptation of existing measuring devices. Thus, the transition from the present to the new operational quantities may be carried out in the most harmonious way possible. It is expected that the new operational quantities will be in force with the next update of Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom. </p>-->
<!--                <p>These changes in standards and quantities will require modifications to the dosimeters, either in the data processing algorithms, or in the physical design of the detectors, or both, to remain in compliance with the type test acceptance criteria. Adaptation of these criteria may be necessary in coordination with the improved measurement accuracy and new technologies discussed above.  </p>-->
<!--                <p>Outcomes for the metrology and scientific communities </p>-->
<!--                <p>The implementation and harmonization of the spectrometry measurements will ensure reliable validation and calculation of laboratory-specific conversion coefficients. The guidance developed within this project will lead to a better understanding of uncertainties and comparable procedures and increasing therefore the confidence in radiation metrology and testing. Spectrometry will provide more accurate and complete data on radiation beams, which is currently available only to a few institutes, and thus will help proliferation of scientific knowledge, techniques and associated research. With expanded spectrometric capabilities, institutes can develop new radiation fields for future applications, needed to metrologically support developments in technology and regulation.</p>-->
<!--                <p>The evaluation of the impact of the new ICRU Report 95 quantities on the photon reference field standards will allow for an informed realization of calibration fields in the metrology institutes and calibration laboratories. </p>-->
<!--                <p>Outcomes for relevant standards </p>-->
<!--                <p>The project will contribute to the implementation and future updates of the ISO 4037 standards series and IEC standards that set requirements for radiation protection dosimeters by providing relevant data, guidance documents and validated limits for the performance of the dosimeters. Moreover, the implementation of the newly proposed operational quantities of ICRU Report 95 will have an impact on some of the limits given by the ISO 4037:2019-1 standard for matched and characterized reference fields and on the radiation doses recorded by the dosimeters. This will affect the personal doses that are monitored nowadays in compliance with Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom and will have an effect on the dose limits and the future update of this Basic Safety Standard and national implementations thereof. </p>-->
<!--                <p>Longer-term economic, social and environmental impacts </p>-->
<!--                <p>Stronger confidence in radiation protection dosimetry, both via the promotion of the implementation of the ISO 4037 standard series, and via the assessment of the impact of the new operational quantities defined in ICRU Report 95 on daily measurements in radiation protection, has the clear potential of making radiation protection dosimetry practices even better than presently; it also enables small laboratories to set up the reference beams according to the standard, thus increasing the availability of harmonized testing and calibration services. This provides an advantage to European-based dosimeter manufacturers on the global market. </p>-->
<!--                <p>Through the objectives of this project, procedures will be brought to maturity so that the implementation of the ISO 4037 standard series both at NMI/DIs and through European national networks of accredited dosimetry calibration laboratories will be facilitated and, therefore, requests of instrument tests and calibrations can be satisfied within Europe. </p>-->
<!--                <p>With the adoption of the new ISO 4037:2019 standard series throughout Europe, and with the related CMCs and services that derive from them, the European citizen would find him/herself in a context of measurement confidence and reliability, the basis on which citizen safety and security can hinge on.</p>-->
<!--                <p>More reliable, accurate, and harmonized tested instrumentation in radiation protection dosimetry, possibly supported by the well-informed technical adoption of the new operational quantities defined in ICRU Report 95, could also lead to a stronger European industry and an increased wealth that this can bring.</p>-->
