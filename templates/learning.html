        <p>A fundamental part of the 22NRM07 GuideRadPROS EMP project is to provide <strong>learning
            resources</strong> on the <strong>ISO 4037</strong> standard series, focusing on how to calibrate
            photon dosimeters.
            The <strong>target groups</strong> of these learning resources are National Metrology Institutes,
            Institutes and Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratories.
            Two types of learning resources are developed within the 22NRM07 GuideRadPROS EMP project:
            <strong>training courses</strong> and <strong>open e-learning materials</strong>.</p>

                    We are excited to invite you to the first GuideRadPROS workshop,
                    taking place in May 2025 in Greece!
                    The workshop will focus on <strong>"Calibrating photon dosimeters to ISO 4037 standards and
                    preparing for new radiation protection quantities"</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The workshop aims to equip participants with practical skills for implementing the ISO 4037
                    standards and ICRU Report 95.
                    It will comprise three days of <strong>lectures and discussions</strong>, followed by
                    <strong>hands-on sessions</strong>, where participants will be divided into basic and advanced
                    groups.
                </p>
